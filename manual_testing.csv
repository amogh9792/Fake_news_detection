23461,REPORT: ‘Federal Government Escalated the Violence in Oregon’," KILLED: Rancher and protest spokesman Robert  Lavoy  Finicum (Image Source: RT International)21st Century Wire says New eye witness testimony indicates that the FBI and other federal agencies were never fired upon, but have shot and killed leading protester, Robert  Lavoy  Finicum, and wounding one other in a elaborate operation that took place along a rural highway near Burns, Oregon.For 26 days since the protest and occupation began at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge outside of Burns, Oregon there were no one was hurt and there were no injuries. That all changed early Tuesday evening when the FBI and Oregon State Police raised the ante, bringing the 4 week standoff to a dramatic ending.As detailed in yesterday s report, according to 18 yr old passenger and eyewitness, Victoria Sharp, dozens of federal vehicles and armed agents had set-up a pre-positioned roadblocks along an isolated stretch of rural Highway 395 before intercepting two vehicles and firing upon one of them, killing rancher and protest spokesman, Robert  Lavoy  Finicum, from Chino Valley, Arizona, and wounding Ryan Bundy of Bunkerville, Nevada.A total of 8 persons were detained, 5 of whom were charged with conspiracy to impede federal officers and are waiting arraignment.21WIRE journalist Patrick Henningsen weighs in on the situation in Oregon and discusses its implications with news anchor Rory Suchet from RT International. Watch: UPDATE 1-28-2016 at 11:30PM ET: Due to public pressure and intense speculation about the events of Tuesday evening, and because of the YouTube recording of 18 yr old eye witness Victoria Sharp, the FBI has released the unedited aerial video footage from Tuesday evening s incident which took place along Highway 395 here. According to the official FBI statement:  We feel that it is necessary to show the whole thing unedited in the interest of transparency.  The FBI video entitled,  Complete, Unedited Video of Joint FBI and OSP Operation 01/26/2016 , does show the victim Lavoy Finicum exiting the truck awkwardly in at least two feet of snow, and he clearly does not  charge towards  the SWAT team, and his hands are clearly held high above his head as he exits his truck when confronted by a SWAT team, before being shot multiple times by marksmen and falling in the snow. Also, the scale and size of this operation is very evident by the footage, and the apprehension of the protesters was not the result of a mere  traffic stop  as it was wrongly characterized in multiple mainstream media reports. On its own, this FBI drone footage would appear to support previous government and media claims by CNN, Washington Post and others that the victim was indeed  reaching towards his waistband  which gave federal and state police justification to unleash deadly force. However, it is still not completely clear from this aerial footage whether or not Finicum was holstered (he is said to normally carry a gun on the right hip, but FBI are claiming he had a 9mm gun in his inside left breast pocket), but also whether or not he lowered his arms before, or after he was shot multiple times. For example, if Finicum had his hands in the air and was then was shot in the abdomen first, then any man s natural reaction would be to then lower his hand(s) and clutch the wound. Additionally, if any shots were fired, even in the vicinity, then confusion could have ensued which might have prompted Finicum to reach for his weapon. Either way, it is impossible to make any such a forensic determination without a corresponding audio track  which would help to determine if any shots were fired before Finicum s hand(s) could be seen lowering.WARNING: The following images depict violence and death which some readers may find disturbing.

23463,"Eyewitness Says Feds Ambushed Bundys, 100 Shots Fired at Passengers, Lavoy Finicum Killed With ‘Hands Up’","Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire UPDATE: 1-30-2016 Last night, the standoff at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge outside Burns, Oregon took a rather ugly turn which resulted in one man shot dead and another wounded by federal agents.The latest incident took place as two vehicles carrying protesters, led by Ammon Bundy, were en route to a community meeting in the nearby town of John Day in Oregon.According to numerous mainstream media reports and local media outlet Oregon Live,  federal sources  are telling the media that only  3 shots were fired , but a new eye witness testimony by one of the vehicle s passengers tells a very different story.While the mainstream media is still referring to the event as  a shoot-out , according to this latest eye witness account at the scene   no shots were fired by vehicle passengers.According to eyewitness Victoria Sharp, 18 yrs old, from Kansas, who was a passenger in the same truck driven by Arizona rancher Robert  Lavoy  Finicum, along with Ryan Bundy, Ryan Payne and Shawna Cox   dozens of federal vehicles and countless agents were waiting for the group, pre-positioned at a point along the isolated rural Highway 395, before intercepting the group and detaining 8 persons, including brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy, who were booked into Multnomah County Jail early this morning.Sharp confirmed that the passengers never drew weapons and attempted to get out of their vehicles before federal agents fired  at least 120 shots altogether  at the vehicle carrying her party.RELATED:  Federal Government Escalated the Violence in Oregon Federal agents fired their first shots at passenger and militia leader, Ryan Payne, as he attempted to make contact with the agents by sticking his head and hands out of the window, at which point Payne got back inside the vehicle.Payne then exited the truck and was detained before driver Finicum advanced the vehicle further down the road before sliding into a snow bank on the side of the road.A second vehicle, a Jeep with passengers including Ammon Bundy, had already been stopped by authorities, with its all passengers taken into custody with no one harmed.A third vehicle driving approximately one mile ahead at the front of the convoy, carrying Sharp s mother and young siblings, was allowed to pass through the police roadblocks without incident. Finicum then attempted to drive around the next federal road block, but lost control of the vehicle before careening into snow piled on the road s hard shoulder.After crashing into the snow bank on the side of the highway, the driver, 54 yr old Arizona resident, Lavoy Finicum (photo, above), then exited the vehicle, visibly upset and with his hands in the air, before being gunned down by federal agents. Finicum was walking with his hands in the air, daring federal agents,  Just shoot me! Just shoot me    at which point the agents shot him dead. The witness testimony indicates that his hands were still in the air.Numerous  red dots  from lasers could be seen pointed on the passengers by federal marksmen, in what was described by this witness as an  ambush  by federal authorities. Sharps said,  I had 20 lasers on me when I got out of the car. She also confirmed that Ryan Bundy was shot and wounded in the arm by federal agents was shot while still inside the truck.Federal forces then followed-up by firing CS tear gas rounds around the vehicle, apparently in an attempt to further disable the remaining passengers.At least 40 federal vehicles, as well as many armed federal agents including some seen emerging from the surrounding forest along the highway, should leave little doubt as to the scale and nature of the operation.Listen to Ms. Sharp s harrowing testimony here: IMPORTANT NOTE (UPDATE 1-30-16): According to this recent report by Pedro Quintana from Central Oregon local affiliate News Channel 21, Sheriff Palmer was not at the federal roadblock and had no prior knowledge of the FBI ambush of the Bundy convoy. According to the chat session relayed in Pedro Quintana s report, Palmer was asked in an online chat,  Did you witness Lavoy shooting, or no? , to which Palmer replies,  NO  The shooting from what I hear was close to 4 and I heard of it at about 5:45pm.  News 21continued: Palmer responded he had no knowledge of anything about the plans or who was coming to the public meeting. He went on to say that the  FBI and Oregon State Police know me, they shared nothing with me and they know I wouldn t have allowed it. Earlier mainstream media reports that Palmer was present at the FBI roadblock would lead Bundy supporters to believe that Palmer had betrayed the Bundys and Lavoy Finicum. One the main sources, if not the main source of the original Sheriff Palmer controversy appears to be none other than Oregon Live staff writer Les Zaitz who has slipped-in this key piece of line into his report which which says: They said they didn t know how long the roadblock would be place. Grant County Sheriff Glenn Palmer was there.  Not surprisingly, this has set-off a virtual backlash online against the Grant County Sheriff, as evidenced by the following screen shot of Google search link found here:  Is this a case of media dirty tricks by Oregon Live? Certainly, Oregon Live s coverage of Burns events has been skewed from the beginning, and have been running character assassination pieces against Malheur occupiers in a effort to discredit the protest. Sheriff Palmer is clearly on record as being sympathetic to the Hammond Ranch protest and had recently opened up a constructive dialogue with the Bundys and occupiers from Malheur Wildlife Refuge. If Pedro Quintana s News 21 report is indeed accurate, then one might conclude that Oregon Live put out a piece of disinformation, likely designed to further divide the protest movement and create dissension in militia and activist ranks. However, until Sheriff Glenn Palmer comes out and issues clear statement declaring where he was   and where he wasn t, then people will continue to speculate what really happened. (END OF UPDATE)Conflicting AccountsReporter Les Zaitz from Oregon Live, a key source of mainstream media information from the Refuge protest, did not give prominence to Victoria Sharp s account in his article, but instead chose to lead with and highlight the secondhand account of the other vehicle s passenger Mark McConnell who claimed that unarmed victim Lavoy Finicum  charged at law enforcement  before being shot. Zaitz s article even admits that McConnell s vehicle was at least 200 yards behind the truck driven by Finicum.Incredibly, Oregonian Zaitz appears to favor McConnell s account on the basis that his account has  matched accounts from law enforcement sources.  McConnell issued his version of events after being released from law enforcement custody, where he spoke for 2 hours with federal agents.Tabloid news site Raw Story also ran with a similar narrative with a deceptive headline that read  Eyewitnesses knock down conspiracy theories about LaVoy Finicum , referring to secondhand accounts by McConnell and colleague, Melvin Lee.As it turns out, Mark McConnell did not actually see the shooting, and instead had  pieced together  his account, as evidenced by his own statement later posted online: going off of what Shawna Cox and Ryan Payne were saying, which were in the vehicle, um, Visually, I seen the truck take off, you know, now any time someone takes off in a vehicle away from law enforcement after they exercise a stop, it s typically considered an act of aggression and foolish. Payne said while they were sitting there and they were clearing my vehicle that him and LeVoy had a heated discussion but he took off they had to chase him, and from what Shawna Cox was saying  from inside of his truck that when he exited the vehicle  he charged after law enforcement . What I do know to be true, from what Payne said and what Shawna said taken pieces here and pieces there and from what I witnessed, um, I didn t see the shooting, um, he was not on his knees, he was not, none of that non sense, that was a miscommunication on somebody else s part but he went after em, he charged em. Here, McConnell is, in effect, issuing a proxy statement on behalf of Victoria Sharp s fellow passengers, Shawn Cox and Ryan Payne. This is hardly admissible, as both Cox and Payne are currently in federal custody and are not able to verify the accuracy of McConnell reiteration. And yet, mainstream media outlets are propping-up McConnell s account, while minimizing Sharp s.After speculating about the shooting, McConnell then says,   I didn t see it, and I m not going to speculate on it. McConnell is said to have been driving in the rear vehicle with Ammon Bundy and his private security, Brian Cavalier.SEE ALSO: Activists or Terrorist? The Truth About the Oregon StandoffUPDATE 1-28-2016: On Wednesday evening, CNN International released a report based on an  anonymous government source  claiming that Finicum was killed by federal agents because he was  reaching towards his waistband.  The Washington Post then re-spun the story, and rather incredibly   is relying on the very same secondhand story presented by Mark McConnell, in a desperate attempt to prop-up the government s version of events: In the moments before he was shot by authorities Tuesday afternoon, Finicum led a high-speed getaway attempt. He then reached for his waistband, prompting authorities to open fire, according to a CNN report.The report, which cites anonymous law enforcement officials but has not been confirmed by The Washington Post, is corroborated by a statement from an occupier who said he was traveling with Finicum at the time of the traffic stop. The fact the media have chosen to label this incident as a  traffic stop  indicates an obvious agenda designed to minimize the obvious   that this was a pre-planned, elaborate ambush by the FBI and Oregon State Police.This same unnamed  source  cited by CNN is also told the network that the incident was indeed captured on video by the FBI, but that authorities  have not decided whether or not the release the video.  (see more breaking updates on this development below)See a full breakdown CNN, Washington Post and the government narrative here.Federal EscalationThis shocking turn of events comes just days after Oregon governor Kate Brown issued what some might consider to be a veiled threat to the protesters and militia, saying that the federal government  must move quickly to end the occupation and hold all of the wrongdoers accountable. Reports last week indicated that the governor had personally written the White House and President Obama, which specifically addressed Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI director James Comey, in which Brown expressed her outrage that Harney County and the state of Oregon was not being recognized for its  collaborative achievements , but rather for  outsiders seeking to exploit and manipulate a local matter for their own agenda. According to the FBI s press release, arrested individuals include:Ammon Edward Bundy, 40, of Emmett, Idaho Ryan C. Bundy, 43, of Bunkerville, Nevada Brian Cavalier, 44, of Bunkerville, Nevada Shawna Cox, 59, of Kanab, Utah Ryan Waylen Payne, 32, of Anaconda, Montana Joseph Donald O Shaughnessy, 45, of Cottonwood, ArizonaAfter the federal operation on Highway 395, in a separate incident back at the Wildlife Refuge, YouTube and internet radio personality, Peter Santilli, 50, of Cincinnati, Ohio, approached the venue and walked towards federal agents before being taken into custody.BREAKING: Booking photos of Ammon Bundy, 7 others after arrest near Burns. https://t.co/AcqRyP4pd5 #KOIN6News pic.twitter.com/un82wepf95  Brent Weisberg (@BrentKOIN) January 27, 2016Those still in detention are scheduled to be arraigned at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Portland.According to reports, FBI agents in Phoenix also  made a probable cause arrest of Jon Eric Ritzheimer, age 32, on a federal charge related to the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon. Jon Ritzheimer, another controversial YouTube personality and former US Marine, appears to have left the Malheur Refuge right before the federal operation to apprehend the protesters, when he returned to his home in Peoria, Arizona.Back at the Refuge protest site, the FBI are said to be negotiating with remaining 8 to 10 occupiers inside, with reports that most women and minors have already left the site.Three weeks ago, Finicum, who become the protest s media spokesperson, made a prophetic statement on camera saying that,  There are things more important than your life, and freedom is one of them.  Watch:UPDATE 1-28-2016: Any public distrust or skepticism of the federal authorities would immediately be dispelled by speed release of all video footage (with dozens of agents and surveillance, there should have been more than one video feed taken, including body and gun sight cameras) of the event. Whether or not, and how fast this will happen remains to be seen.UPDATE 1-29-2016 at 01:30PM ET: Due to public pressure and intense speculation about the events of Tuesday evening, and also because of the YouTube recording of eye witness 18 yr old Victoria Sharp, the FBI has released the unedited aerial video footage from Tuesday evening s incident which took place along Highway 395 here. According to the official FBI statement:  We feel that it is necessary to show the whole thing unedited in the interest of transparency.

23465,‘There’ll be boots on the ground’: US making noises about ‘doing more’ in Syria and Iraq,"21st Century Wire says Various parties in Washington are quietly laying down the rhetorical tarmac for an increased US military operation in Syria.Recent remarks by US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter (see report below) in Davos appear to dovetail with similar words yesterday from US Vice President Joe Biden who stated,  We are prepared to have a military solution for this operation, and taking out Daesh (ISIS). The following was reported by Press TV yesterday, but as yet, we cannot corroborate the story: The United States denies its special operations troops have taken over an airfield in northeastern Syria, near the country s border with Iraq and Turkey. A spokesman of the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) said Friday that the military  denied that US forces have taken control of any airfield in Syria . However, a spokesperson for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) told Al Jazeera earlier this week that the US special operations forces had taken over the airfield near the city of Rmeilan in Syria s Hasakah province to support Kurdish fighters against the Daesh (ISIL) Takfiri group. Regardless, don t think for one second that the Pentagon doesn t already have some boots on the ground inside Syria  DELTA FORCE: According to a report at Friends of Syria, US Delta Force units are already on the ground in southern Syria near Jordanian border (Image Source: South Front)RTSecretary of Defense Ash Carter has reiterated US plans to increase its military presence in the campaign to retake Mosul and Raqqa from Islamic State, but urged other members of its coalition   like Turkey   to contribute more to the war effort. We re looking for opportunities to do more, and there will be boots on the ground   I want to be clear about that   but it s a strategic question, whether you are enabling local forces to take and hold, rather than trying to substitute for them,  Carter told CNBC from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. I don t think we or anybody else can substitute for them, but there s a lot we can do to enable them, including being on the ground with them.

23467,Oregon Governor Says Feds ‘Must Act’ Against Protesters and Armed Groups in Burns,"21st Century Wire says So far, after nearly 20 days of protests near Burns, Oregon, there s been no one hurt or injured, but it seems the state s chief executive is keen to change that result.According to reports today, Oregon Governor Kate Brown told a news conference hat federal officials,  must move quickly to end the occupation and hold all of the wrongdoers accountable. The governor does not appear at all concerned with the Hammond family s plight, nor with any of this story s core issues like legal minimum sentencing, jury nullification, or private, state and federal land rights   and yet, seems to want an armed confrontation in her state   and not with any of her own state or county law enforcement agents, but by using federal agents instead. PLEADING TO FEDS: Oregon governor Kate Brown.She added,  Residents of Harney County have been overlooked and underserved by federal officials  response thus far. I have conveyed these very grave concerns directly to our leaders at the highest levels of our government: the U.S. Department of Justice and the White House. The Democratic governor also claims that the protest has cost the state over $500,000 over the last 3 weeks.  We ll be asking federal officials to reimburse the state for these costs. It s not clear exactly how she arrived at that figure, but it can t be from calculating Harney County sheriff s deputies overtime pay.Harney County Judge Steve Grasty also voice a desire to see federal agents take a more aggressive approach towards Ammon Bundy and his fellow protesters, saying,  I hope they lock it down.

23470,"Arizona Rancher Protesting in Oregon is Targeted by CPS, Loses Custody of Foster Children","RTOne of the most visible members of the armed militia that took over a wildlife refuge in Oregon says his four foster sons were taken away due to his involvement in the standoff, and he blames the federal government who  must have gotten to the governor. Robert  LaVoy  Finicum and his wife Jeanette have fostered more than 50 boys over the last decade at their ranch near Chino Valley, Arizona. The couple is licensed and has a care contract with the Catholic Charities Community Services. Many of the children came from mental hospitals, drug rehabs and group homes for emotionally distressed youth, he told Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB). IMAGE: Robert  LaVoy  Finicum. My ranch has been a great tool for these boys,  Finicum said.  It has done a lot of good. He traveled to Oregon to take part in the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge at the beginning of January, leaving Jeanette to care for the four boys. But now the Finicums have no more fosters to care for.A social worker began removing the last four of the family s foster kids on January 4, the fourth day of the Oregon standoff. The last left five days later, he said. They didn t go out at the same time,  Finicum said.  One was there for a year, one of the boys was there six months, another eight months, and a month. I don t know where they ended up. He blamed the kids  removals on pressure from the feds. They were ripped from my wife,  Finicum said.  We are very successful [foster parents]. Our track records are good, it s been a good relationship. [Federal authorities] must have gotten to the governor, who told the state to get them out of there.

21407,"Mata Pires, owner of embattled Brazil builder OAS, dies","SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Cesar Mata Pires, the owner and co-founder of Brazilian engineering conglomerate OAS SA, one of the largest companies involved in Brazil s corruption scandal, died on Tuesday. He was 68. Mata Pires died of a heart attack while taking a morning walk in an upscale district of S o Paulo, where OAS is based, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. Efforts to contact his family were unsuccessful. OAS declined to comment. The son of a wealthy cattle rancher in the northeastern state of Bahia, Mata Pires  links to politicians were central to the expansion of OAS, which became Brazil s No. 4 builder earlier this decade, people familiar with his career told Reuters last year. His big break came when he befriended Antonio Carlos Magalh es, a popular politician who was Bahia governor several times, and eventually married his daughter Tereza. Brazilians joked that OAS stood for  Obras Arranjadas pelo Sogro  - or  Work Arranged by the Father-In-Law.   After years of steady growth triggered by a flurry of massive government contracts, OAS was ensnared in Operation Car Wash which unearthed an illegal contracting ring between state firms and builders. The ensuing scandal helped topple former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff last year. Trained as an engineer, Mata Pires founded OAS with two colleagues in 1976 to do sub-contracting work for larger rival Odebrecht SA - the biggest of the builders involved in the probe.  Before the scandal, Forbes magazine estimated Mata Pires  fortune at $1.6 billion. He dropped off the magazine s billionaire list in 2015, months after OAS sought bankruptcy protection after the Car Wash scandal. While Mata Pires was never accused of wrongdoing in the investigations, creditors demanded he and his family stay away from the builder s day-to-day operations, people directly involved in the negotiations told Reuters at the time. He is survived by his wife and his two sons.         ",worldnews,"August 22, 2017 ",1

Security Council sanctions and ignored all calls, including from major ally China, to stop, prompting a bellicose exchange of rhetoric between the North and the United States. North Korea justifies its weapons programs, including its recent threat to fire missiles towards the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, by pointing to perceived U.S. hostility, such as military exercises with South Korea this week. U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood told a U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva U.S. President Donald Trump s top priority was to protect the United States and its allies against the  growing threat  from North Korea and America was ready to use  the full range of capabilities  at its disposal. The  path to dialogue still remained an option  for Pyongyang and it had the choice between poverty and belligerence on the one hand and prosperity and acceptance. North Korea s envoy told the same forum the North s nuclear deterrent would never be up for negotiation, echoing Pyongyang s regular denunciation of U.S.  aggression .  The measures taken by the DPRK to strengthen its nuclear deterrence and develop inter-continental rockets is justifiable and a legitimate option for self-defense in the face of such apparent and real threats,  diplomat Ju Yong Chol told the forum, referring to  constant nuclear threats  by the United States. DPRK stands for the North s official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea. Regarding joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises that began on Monday, he warned:  The ongoing military adventure would certainly add gasoline to the fire, driving the current tense situation to further deterioration.  Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said pressure must be maintained until the North demonstrated it would give up its nuclear program.  It s not the time to discuss (the resumption of) six-party talks,  Kono said, referring to stalled negotiations involving both Koreas, the United States, Russia, China and Japan.  It s time to exert pressure,  he told reporters. The head of the U.S. military s Pacific Command said diplomacy was key. Admiral Harry Harris was in South Korea to observe annual joint military drills with the South Korean military, which the North called a step towards nuclear conflict masterminded by  war maniacs .  So we hope and we work for diplomatic solutions to the challenge presented by Kim Jong Un,  Harris told reporters at a U.S. air base in Osan, about an hour from Seoul, referring to the North Korean leader. He said diplomacy was  the most important starting point  in response to the North s threat, when asked what actions by North Korea might trigger a preemptive U.S. strike against it.  As far as a timeline, it would be crazy for me to share with you those tripwires in advance. If we did that, it would hardly be a military strategy,  he said. The United States and South Korea began the long-planned exercises on Monday, called the Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which the allies have said are purely defensive. The drills involve tens of thousands of troops as well as computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear-capable North Korea. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with the North because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.  Delegations from about 20 countries spoke at the four-hour U.N. session, including Britain, France, Australia and South Korea, all of which criticized North Korea.  I would like to repeat the appeal to the DPRK to listen to the fact that there is no alternative to stopping the different provocations and to return to dialogue,  South Korean ambassador Kim Inchul said.  We have never threatened the DPRK with any attacks and we have never promoted the use of force.  ",worldnews,"August 22, 2017 ",1
21409,"U.S., North Korea clash at U.N. arms forum on nuclear threat","GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea and the United States accused each other on Tuesday of posing a nuclear threat, with Pyongyang s envoy declaring it would never put its atomic arsenal up for negotiation. The debate at the United Nations began when the U.S. envoy said President Donald Trump s top priority was to protect the United States and its allies against the  growing threat  from North Korea. To do so, he said, the country was ready to use  the full range of capabilities at our disposal . U.S. Ambassador Robert Wood told the Conference on Disarmament that the  path to dialogue still remains an option  for Pyongyang, but that Washington was  undeterred in defending against the threat North Korea poses . Fears have grown over North Korea s development of missiles and nuclear weapons since Pyongyang test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in July. Those fears worsened after Trump warned that North Korea would face  fire and fury  if it threatened the United States. His remarks led North Korea to say it was considering plans to fire missiles towards the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam. Trump responded by tweeting that the U.S. military was  locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely . A few days later, North Korean media reported the country s leader, Kim Jong Un, had delayed any decision on whether to fire missiles towards Guam while he waited to see what the United States would do. Experts warned Pyongyang could still go ahead with the missile launches.      North Korea s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs pose grave threats to the entire world,  Wood told the Geneva forum.  Its recent ICBM tests are another example of the dangerous reckless behavior of the North that is destabilizing the region and beyond.  North Korea had openly stated that its missiles are intended to strike cities in the United States and its allies South Korea and Japan, he said.  My president s top priority remains protecting the homeland, U.S. territories and our allies against North Korean aggression. We remain prepared to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal against the growing threat from North Korea.  North Korea diplomat Ju Yong Chol said that measures taken by his country to strengthen its nuclear deterrent and develop inter-continental rockets were  justifiable and a legitimate option .  As long as the U.S. hostile policy and nuclear threat remains unchallenged, the DPRK will never place its self-defensive nuclear deterrence on the negotiating table or step back an inch from the path it took to bolster the national nuclear force,  Ju said. In a subsequent speech, Ju said:  The United States should clearly understand that military threats and pressure are only serving as a momentum that pushes the DPRK further into developing fully strengthened nuclear deterrence.  Regarding joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises that began on Monday, he said:  The ongoing military adventure would certainly add gasoline to the fire, driving the current tense situation to further deterioration.  China s disarmament ambassador, Fu Cong, called for support for its proposal to defuse the crisis affecting its Pyongyang ally.  China has called for  dual suspension , that is of North Korea s nuclear activities and joint military exercises between the Republic of Korea and United States. This seeks to denuclearize the peninsula and promote a security mechanism.  Wood rejected Beijing s  freeze for freeze  plan.  This proposal unfortunately creates a false equivalency between states that are engaging in legitimate exercises of self-defense who have done so for many years with a regime that has basically violated countless Security Council resolutions with regard to its proscribed nuclear and ballistic missile programs,  he told the gathering.  That is a false equivalency that we cannot accept and will not accept,  he said. Fu retorted:  I just want to say that we re not creating equivalency between anything. We are just actually making the proposal to facilitate a dialogue and to reduce the tension. We need a starting point to really launch the dialogue.  ",worldnews,"August 22, 2017 ",1
21410,Headless torso could belong to submarine journalist: Danish police,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish police said on Tuesday the size of a headless female torso found on the sea s edge in Copenhagen suggested it could be that of a Swedish journalist who died after taking a submarine ride with the vessel s Danish inventor. Police said divers were still searching the area and they were investigating reports of other body parts that may have been spotted in Copenhagen harbor. Danish inventor Peter Madsen has been charged with killing Kim Wall, a Swedish journalist, in his home-made submarine.   We re dealing with a torso where arms, legs and head were cut off deliberately. The length of the torso doesn t speak against it being Kim Wall, but we still don t know,  Copenhagen police spokesman Jens Moller said in a video statement. Madsen told a court she had died in an accident on board the submarine and that he had buried her at sea, changing his earlier statement that he dropped her off alive in Copenhagen. Police are conducting DNA tests to identify the torso - found on Monday by a passing cyclist - and the results are due Wednesday morning, Moller said. The bizarre case has dominated Danish and Swedish media, and drawn interest from around the world. Madsen has been charged with the manslaughter of Wall, who has been missing since he took her out to sea in his 17-metre (56 feet) submarine on Aug. 10. He denies the charge. He was rescued a day later after his UC3 Nautilus sank in the narrow strait between Denmark and Sweden. Police found nobody else in the wreck. Madsen, an entrepreneur, artist, submarine builder and aerospace engineer, went before a judge on Saturday for preliminary questioning. The case is closed to the public in order to protect further investigations, police said. ",worldnews,"August 22, 2017 ",1
21411,North Korea shipments to Syria chemical arms agency intercepted: U.N. report,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Two North Korean shipments to a Syrian government agency responsible for the country s chemical weapons program were intercepted in the past six months, according to a confidential United Nations report on North Korea sanctions violations. The report by a panel of independent U.N. experts, which was submitted to the U.N. Security Council earlier this month and seen by Reuters on Monday, gave no details on when or where the interdictions occurred or what the shipments contained.   The panel is investigating reported prohibited chemical, ballistic missile and conventional arms cooperation between Syria and the DPRK (North Korea),  the experts wrote in the 37-page report.   Two member states interdicted shipments destined for Syria. Another Member state informed the panel that it had reasons to believe that the goods were part of a KOMID contract with Syria,  according to the report. KOMID is the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation. It was blacklisted by the Security Council in 2009 and described as Pyongyang s key arms dealer and exporter of equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons. In March 2016 the council also blacklisted two KOMID representatives in Syria.   The consignees were Syrian entities designated by the European Union and the United States as front companies for Syria s Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC), a Syrian entity identified by the Panel as cooperating with KOMID in previous prohibited item transfers,  the U.N. experts wrote.  SSRC has overseen the country s chemical weapons program since the 1970s. The U.N. experts said activities between Syria and North Korea they were investigating included cooperation on Syrian Scud missile programs and maintenance and repair of Syrian surface-to-air missiles air defense systems. The North Korean and Syrian missions to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The experts said they were also investigating the use of the VX nerve agent in Malaysia to kill the estranged half-brother of North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un in February.  North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the Security Council has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear weapons tests and four long-range missile launches. Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. However, diplomats and weapons inspectors suspect Syria may have secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. During the country s more than six-year long civil war the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has said the banned nerve agent sarin has been used at least twice, while the use of chlorine as a weapon has been widespread. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. ",worldnews,"August 21, 2017 ",1
21412,'Fully committed' NATO backs new U.S. approach on Afghanistan,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO allies on Tuesday welcomed President Donald Trump s decision to commit more forces to Afghanistan, as part of a new U.S. strategy he said would require more troops and funding from America s partners. Having run for the White House last year on a pledge to withdraw swiftly from Afghanistan, Trump reversed course on Monday and promised a stepped-up military campaign against  Taliban insurgents, saying:  Our troops will fight to win .  U.S. officials said he had signed off on plans to send about 4,000 more U.S. troops to add to the roughly 8,400 now deployed in Afghanistan. But his speech did not define benchmarks for successfully ending the war that began with the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, and which he acknowledged had required an   extraordinary sacrifice of blood and treasure .  We will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy, with additional troops and funding increases in line with our own. We are confident they will,  Trump said. That comment signaled he would further increase pressure on U.S. partners who have already been jolted by his repeated demands to step up their contributions to NATO and his description of the alliance as  obsolete  - even though, since taking office, he has said this is no longer the case. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement:  NATO remains fully committed to Afghanistan and I am looking forward to discussing the way ahead with (Defense) Secretary (James) Mattis and our Allies and international partners.  NATO has 12,000 troops in Afghanistan, and 15 countries have pledged more, Stoltenberg said. Britain, a leading NATO member, called the U.S. commitment  very welcome .  In my call with Secretary Mattis yesterday we agreed that despite the challenges, we have to stay the course in Afghanistan to help build up its fragile democracy and reduce the terrorist threat to the West,  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said. Germany, which has borne the brunt of Trump s criticism over  the scale of its defense spending, also welcomed the new U.S. plan.  Our continued commitment is necessary on the path to stabilizing the country,  a government spokeswoman said. In June, European allies had already pledged more troops but had not given details on numbers, waiting for the Trump administration to outline its strategy for the region.Nearly 16 years after the U.S.-led invasion - a response to the Sept. 11 attacks which were planned by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan - the country is still struggling with weak central government and a Taliban insurgency. Trump said he shared the frustration of the American people who were  weary of war without victory , but a hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for groups like Islamic State and al Qaeda to fill.

21413,LexisNexis withdrew two products from Chinese market,"LONDON (Reuters) - LexisNexis, a provider of legal, regulatory and business information, said on Tuesday it had withdrawn two products from the Chinese market in March this year after it was asked to remove some content.  The issue of academic freedom in China hit the headlines this week after the leading British academic publisher,  Cambridge University Press, said it had complied with a request to block online access to some scholarly articles in China.  It later reversed its position.   Earlier this year LexisNexis Business Insight Solutions in China was asked to remove some content from its database,  LexisNexis said in a statement.  In March 2017, the company withdrew two products (Nexis and LexisNexis Academic) from the Chinese market.  LexisNexis is owned by information group Relx. ",worldnews,"August 22, 2017 ",1
21414,Minsk cultural hub becomes haven from authorities,"MINSK (Reuters) - In the shadow of disused Soviet-era factories in Minsk, a street lined with eclectic bars, art galleries and yoga studios has become a haven from the vigilant eyes of the Belarussian authorities.  This place is like an island,  said Yegor, 21, who works at  popular bar Hooligan.  It s the street of freedom.  The government of President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for the past 23 years and has boasted that he is  the last and only dictator in Europe  ,has little tolerance for any opposition. A powerful police force and feared state security  keep citizens in check. But police patrols are rare in Oktyabrskaya, partly due to its location on an out-of-the-way peninsula in a bend of the river Svislach. When the first restaurant opened there in 2012, few visitors came but now it ranks among the most fashionable quarters of Minsk.  Such is the growing popularity of that Oktyabrskaya that investors such as Belgazprombank, a subsidiary of state-owned Russian lender Gazprombank, have big plans for the district. Earlier this year the bank purchased part of a factory there and intends to turn it into a gallery, restaurant and theater complex. The manufacturing sector has not entirely abandoned Oktyabrskaya - one  machine-making factory named after the 1917 October Revolution (MZOR) still operates there. Financial difficulties prompted state-owned MZOR to lease or sell some of its facilities to Oktyabrskaya s developers, but the firm still maintains some production with a reduced workforce. Mikhail, who has worked at the factory for 42 years, said he approves of the influx of new  hipster  businesses.  The street has come back to life,  he said. Oktyabrskaya s long-term future ultimately depends on the authorities good favor, cultural analyst Maksim Zhbankov said.  For now they tolerate it. But I can t say that someone won t turn up tomorrow and say they ve decided to tear it all down,  he said. ",worldnews,"August 22, 2017 ",1
21415,Vatican upbeat on possibility of Pope Francis visiting Russia,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin said on Tuesday that there was  positive momentum  behind the idea of Pope Francis visiting Russia, but suggested there was more work to be done if it were to happen.  Parolin, speaking at a joint news conference in Moscow alongside Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, did not give any date for such a possible visit. The Eastern and Western branches of Christianity split apart in 1054. The pope, leader of the world s 1.2 billion Catholics, is seeking to improve ties, and last year in Cuba held what was the first ever meeting between a Roman Catholic pope and a Russian Orthodox patriarch.  Parolin said he had also used his talks in the Russian capital to also raise certain difficulties faced by the Catholic Church in Russia. He said that Moscow and the Vatican disagreed about the plight of Christians in certain parts of the world. He did not elaborate. Parolin, who is due later on Tuesday to meet Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, said he also believed Russia could play an important role when it came to helping solve a crisis in Venezuela because of its close relations with Caracas.

21416,Indonesia to buy $1.14 billion worth of Russian jets,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia will buy 11 Sukhoi fighter jets worth $1.14 billion from Russia in exchange for cash and Indonesian commodities, two cabinet ministers said on Tuesday. The Southeast Asian country has pledged to ship up to $570 million worth of commodities in addition to cash to pay for the Suhkoi SU-35 fighter jets, which are expected to be delivered in stages starting in two years. Indonesian Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita said in a joint statement with Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu that details of the type and volume of commodities were  still being negotiated . Previously he had said the exports could include palm oil, tea, and coffee. The deal is expected to be finalised soon between Indonesian state trading company PT Perusahaan Perdangangan Indonesia and Russian state conglomerate Rostec. Russia is currently facing a new round of U.S.-imposed trade sanctions. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia s largest economy is trying to promote its palm oil products amid threats of a cut in consumption by European Union countries. Indonesia is also trying to modernize its ageing air force after a string of military aviation accidents. Indonesia, which had a $411 million trade surplus with Russia in 2016, wants to expand bilateral cooperation in tourism, education, energy, technology and aviation among others.
